                <p class="lead">When programming, I could see that there are things that can be automated. I liked mobile applications because they provide practical solutions to needs.</p>
                <p class="lead">In the last few years I specialized in learning android on my own because it was what was within my reach, and when I had the opportunity, I was able to meet ios. In general, mobile applications caught my attention because everything that is built lends itself to easy interaction.</p>
                <p class="lead">I loved Android because it was the system that allowed me to create applications with the knowledge that I already had in Java programming and with the resources that I already had. But that was not enough to continue learning and reinventing the way of making applications, which is why I took it a little more professionally.</p>

                <p class="lead">My story of the pandemic began in March 2020 precisely when the suspension of activities began. By this time I was just starting my current job at Aeromexico. Due to the international relations that it maintains, the action measures for this situation were already planned.</p>
                <p class="lead">They sent us to the home office and that's when it all started. I took the opportunity to advance in school since for personal reasons and for time he had not given me the opportunity to continue. Since the classes were virtual, I was able to advance more in my credits from 60% to 80% and it continues to increase.</p>
                <p class="lead">Personally, I took it as a challenge, since the situation began to get complicated because I did not have a space to carry out my activities. That made me motivate to focus on myself, it was when I made the decision to buy an apartment and do everything that implies. To have the objective of becoming independent since even before the pandemic I was still living with my family. It has cost me a lot of work but I have great sadisfaction with what I have achieved.</p>
                <p class="lead">I have also tried to de-stress by taking online photography courses on weekends, because I like it and it amuses me. I think it is a good idea to get out of the ordinary and stop thinking in the same way that I have been doing.</p>
                <p class="lead">I would have loved to go out and have fun and get to know different places but I think that after going through the important thing I can do it without problem once this whole situation is over.</p>

                <p class="lead">3GPP is driving many essential inventions across all aspects of 5G design, from the air interface to the service layer. Other 3GPP 5G members range from infrastructure vendors and component/device manufacturers to mobile network operators and vertical service providers.                </p>
                <p class="lead">5G is based on OFDM (Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing), a method of modulating a digital signal across several different channels to reduce interference. 5G uses 5G NR air interface alongside OFDM principles. 5G also uses wider bandwidth technologies such as sub-6 GHz and mmWave.</p>
                <p class="lead">Like 4G LTE, 5G OFDM operates based on the same mobile networking principles. However, the new 5G NR air interface can further enhance OFDM to deliver a much higher degree of flexibility and scalability. This could provide more 5G access to more people and things for a variety of different use cases.</p>

                <p class="lead">XGS-PON is an updated standard for Passive Optical Networks (PON) that can support higher speed 10 Gbps symmetrical data transfer and is part of the family of standards known as Gigabit-capable PON, or G-PON. G-PON stands for Gigabit PON or 1 Gigabit PON. The “X” in XGS represents the number 10, and the letter “S” stands for symmetrical, XGS-PON = 10 Gigabit Symmetrical PON. An earlier, non-symmetrical 10 Gigabit PON version (XG-PON) was limited to 2.5 Gbps in the upstream direction. </p>
                <p class="lead">PON technology originated in the 1990’s and has continued to develop through multiple iterations with differing wavelengths, speeds and components emerging as the technology has improved. The common denominator of all fiber optic PON networks remains the unpowered or passive state of the fiber and its splitting or combining components, i.e. no active elements such as optical amplifiers, which would require power, are present in the network. With streaming, high definition, 5G and other emerging technologies continually pushing bandwidth demands, the development of XGS-PON and other standards has proven to be essential. </p>
                <p class="lead">Simultaneous upstream and downstream transmission over the same fiber is made possible through wavelength division multiplexing (WDM). This technology allows one XGS-PON wavelength or color of light transmission for upstream and another for downstream.</p>

                <p class="lead">The Internet of Things (IoT) describes the network of physical objects—“things”—that are embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the internet. These devices range from ordinary household objects to sophisticated industrial tools. With more than 7 billion connected IoT devices today, experts are expecting this number to grow to 10 billion by 2020 and 22 billion by 2025. Oracle has a network of device partners.</p>
                <p class="lead">Over the past few years, IoT has become one of the most important technologies of the 21st century. Now that we can connect everyday objects—kitchen appliances, cars, thermostats, baby monitors—to the internet via embedded devices, seamless communication is possible between people, processes, and things.</p>
                <p class="lead">By means of low-cost computing, the cloud, big data, analytics, and mobile technologies, physical things can share and collect data with minimal human intervention. In this hyperconnected world, digital systems can record, monitor, and adjust each interaction between connected things. The physical world meets the digital world—and they cooperate.</p>
